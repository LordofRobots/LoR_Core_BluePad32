*known issues*

- TDSB network admin (on both wifi and lan) seem to block access to some third party libraries that Arduino IDE uses. This will cause issues when installing and updating your libraries. If you are having trouble installing or updating, it is best to connect to the internet on a private network to install and update these items.
